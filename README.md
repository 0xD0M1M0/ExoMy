# ExoMy - The 3D Printed Rover

<img src="https://github.com/esa-prl/ExoMy/wiki/beauty_shots/DSC05713.jpg.jpg" width="400">

ExoMy is the 3D printed rover developed at the European Space Agency.

The rover is inspired by [ExoMars](http://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Human_and_Robotic_Exploration/Exploration/ExoMars) and serves as an educatial tool to learn about mechanics, 3D-printing, electronics, software and rovers.
It features six steerable wheels on a triple bogie suspension which mimics the locomotion capabilities of ExoMars. A camera in the head furthermore allows teleoperation and for very enthusiastic people even computer vision.

## Build it yourself!
ExoMy uses off the shelve components and 3D printed parts. Everyone with access to a 3D printer and basic tools can build ExoMy. This initial version costs around 500€ to build. It is however possible to change certain parts (camera, raspberry pi, servos) for more afforable parts to lower the total cost to around 200 €.

The [software](https://github.com/esa-prl/ExoMy_Software) is completly written in Python with [ROS](https://www.ros.org/) and is completely open source.

A web interface is available to control ExoMy from a smartphone, laptop or tablet.

Download the [files](https://github.com/esa-prl/ExoMy) and the [software](https://github.com/esa-prl/ExoMy_Software).
Then head over to the [wiki](https://github.com/esa-prl/ExoMy/wiki) for detailed instructions on how to build it.
