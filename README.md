ExoMy is the 3D printed rover developed at the European Space Agency.

The rover is inspired by [ExoMars](http://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Human_and_Robotic_Exploration/Exploration/ExoMars) and serves as an educatial tool to learn about mechanics, 3D-printing, electronics, software and rovers.
It features six steerable wheels on a triple bogie suspension which mimics the locomotion capabilities of ExoMars. A camera in the head furthermore allows teleoperation and for very enthusiastic people even computer vision.

## Build it yourself!
ExoMy uses off the shelve components and 3D printed parts. This allows it to be built by anyone with access to a 3D printer.
Head over to the [wiki](https://github.com/esa-prl/ExoMy/wiki) for detailed instructions on how to build it.


ExoMy was developed at the [Planetary Robotics Laboratory](http://www.esa.int/Enabling_Support/Space_Engineering_Technology/Planetary_Robotics_Laboratory) by Miro Voellmy, Maximillian Ehrhardt, Levin Gerdes and Shanker
